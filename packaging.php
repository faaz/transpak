    <h2>Packaging Tips</h2>
    <hr id="hr"/>
    <h3 class="mandcap">The Right Carton</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Whenever possible, pack items in specific transit cartons that are double walled and robust. </li>
      <li>Packaging strength is needed because parcels may be stacked on top of each other in storage and in transit. </li>

      <li>Local packaging suppliers, stationers and post office shops are a good source of transit cartons and other packaging materials. </li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="mandcap">Size Matters</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Choose a box or carton that is a little larger that the items to be packed, to allow protective packaging to be used inside the box. </li>
      <li>Underfilled cartons may collapse. </li>

      <li>Overfilled cartons may burst. </li>
    </ul>
    
<h3 class="mandcap">Invest in Packaging</h3>

<ul><li>Use good materials.
</li><li>It is a false economy to save pennies when protecting contents worth pounds.
</li></ul>




<h3 class="mandcap">Cushioning Counts</h3>

Use cushioning materials like
<ul>
<li>polystyrene beads,</li>
<li>wood straw,</li>
<li>bubble wrap,</li>
<li>shredded paper</li>
</ul>

to cushion goods inside the box and stop contents moving during transit.


<h3 class="mandcap">Delicate and Fragile</h3>

If you are shipping delicate or fragile items

<ul><li>Place them in the centre of the carton
</li><li>Make sure they are not in contact with the outside walls at any point
</li><li>Surround them with adequate cushioning materials.
</li><li>If there is more than one item - for example cups and saucers - place cushioning around each object, as well as around them all.
</li><li>'Fragile' or 'Handle with Care' labels are for information only, and do not confer any magical protective powers!
</li></ul>


<h3 class="mandcap">Smelly, Greasy</h3>

If you are shipping semi-liquid substances like grease, or strong smelling goods

<ul><li>Wrap them in plastic film or grease-resistant paper
</li><li>Seal them with adhesive tape
</li><li>Package them as suggested for delicate and fragile items, above.

</li><li>Leakage or contamination may spoil other items in the same package, so ship them in a dedicated carton.
</li></ul>

<h3 class="mandcap">Powders</h3>

If you are shipping powders and grains

<ul><li>Package them in a dedicated container, or in strong plastic bags. Seal securely.
</li><li>Package them as suggested for delicate and fragile items, above.
</li><li>Leakage or contamination may spoil other items in the same package, so ship them in a dedicated carton.
</li></ul>

<h3 class="mandcap">This Way Up</h3>
<ul><li>Use arrow-up adhesive labels if you are shipping liquids, semi-liquids, powders or grains.
</li><li>They can be bought at stationers, packaging suppliers and some post offices.
</li></ul>

<h3 class="mandcap">It's a Gift</h3>
<ul><li>When sending pre-packaged or pre-wrapped gift items do not rely on the manufacturer's display or presentation packaging.
</li><li>Repack gifts in line with the advice on this page.
</li></ul>

<h3 class="mandcap">Large, Flat And Flexible</h3>

If you are sending large, flat, flexible items, like maps, plans, posters, etc,

<ul><li>Pack them flat between two rigid boards (like hardboard)
</li><li>Or roll them and place them in postal tubes.
</li><li>Triangular tubes are less likely to be damaged than round tubes.
</li></ul>

<h3 class="mandcap">Sound and Vision</h3>

When shipping computer discs, CDs, DVDs, etc.,
<ul><li>Place each one in a protective sleeve
</li><li>Package them tightly together
</li><li>Put them into a strong outer carton, with cushioning materials.
</li></ul>

When shipping magnetic media like audio or video tapes
<ul><li>Consider transferring them onto optical media like DVD or CD ROMS.
</li><li>If this is not possible, package them in protective sleeves
</li><li>Place then in the centre of a larger box.
</li></ul>

<h3 class="mandcap">Sharp Precautions</h3>
When shipping items like tools, knives and scissors

<ul><li>If possible pack them in manufacturer-supplied protective packaging

</li><li>Or in a dedicated sheath that will protect edges and points
</li><li>Or protect edges and points with heavy non-corrugated cardboard, taped securely in place so that it cannot be dislodged
</li><li>Make sure the recipient knows what is in the package, to avoid the possibility of injury during unpacking
</li></ul><br id="brid"/>

<h3 class="mandcap">Recycling</h3>
It is perfectly acceptable to reuse previous packaging material.
<ul><li>Make sure it is undamaged and strength has not been compromised by impact or damp
</li><li>Remove or completely obliterate all previous address, routeing or content information
</li></ul>

<h3 class="mandcap">Close Firmly</h3>
<ul><li>Seal boxes using STRONG parcel tape, or plastic strapping.

</li><li>Domestic adhesive tape is inadequate and can fail in damp or wet conditions.
</li></ul>

<h3 class="mandcap">Addressing</h3>
When using Global Logistic Solutions shipping services
<ul><li>In most instances a properly formatted address label can be printed on your computer printer
</li><li>If you cannot do this, write the address and other information clearly on the outside of the package
</li><li>Use large capital letters and black or dark blue ink to improve readability by shipping staff
</li></ul>

<h3 class="mandcap">Some Do Nots</h3>
<ul><li>Don't use fabric bags as shipping outers.
</li><li>Don't completely seal your package; customs officers may need to open it for inspection.
</li><li>Don't use rope or string to seal boxes. It can break, and it can catch on other packages and cause damage.

</li><li>Do not rely on "Fragile" and "Handle with care" labels as a substitute for careful packaging. They are only appropriate for information purposes.
</li></ul>
